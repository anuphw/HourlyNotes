## üí≠ The Story Behind HourlyNotes

As a GenAI researcher working in the generative image field, I have a confession: I'm terrible at logging my work. I'm chronically lazy about documentation and keep procrastinating on writing down what I've done. "I'll remember this experiment," I tell myself. "I'll log it later when I have more results."

But "later" never comes. Days turn into weeks, and suddenly I'm staring at a blank weekly report with no memory of what I actually accomplished. Worse, as a researcher, I'm constantly running experiments that fail - and I just move on to the next idea without documenting what went wrong. Those failed experiments? They disappear into the void, along with valuable insights about what doesn't work.

The breaking point came during my weekly progress meeting when my advisor asked about a specific experiment I'd run three days earlier. I remembered running it, I remembered it failing, but I couldn't recall the exact setup, the parameters I'd used, or why it failed. All that work and learning - gone.

I realized the problem wasn't that I couldn't remember things - it was that I was trying to remember too much at once. By the end of the week, there was simply too much to recall and log properly. 

That's when I had an idea: What if I could break down the logging into tiny, manageable pieces? Just a gentle hourly reminder asking, "Hey, what did you just work on?" - successful experiments, failed runs, insights, dead ends, everything. No pressure to write a comprehensive report, just capture the moment while it's fresh.

HourlyNotes was born from this laziness-driven problem. It's my solution for procrastinating researchers who need to build up their weekly reports from small, real-time breadcrumbs. Now when Friday comes and I need to write that progress log, I have everything I need - including all those "failed" experiments that actually taught me something valuable.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### ‚≠ê Recommended: Build from Source

For the best experience and to avoid macOS Gatekeeper issues, we recommend compiling the app yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anuphw/HourlyNotes.git
cd HourlyNotes
chmod +x build_native_app.sh
./build_native_app.sh
open HourlyNotes.app
```

**Why build from source?**
- No macOS "damaged app" warnings
- Always get the latest code
- Full control over the build process
- Takes less than 30 seconds to compile

### Alternative: Download Pre-built App

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Pre-built releases require bypassing macOS Gatekeeper since the app is not code-signed.

1. **Download**: Get the latest [HourlyNotes.dmg](https://github.com/anuphw/HourlyNotes/releases/latest)
2. **Install**: Open the DMG and drag HourlyNotes.app to Applications
3. **Launch**: **Right-click** the app and select "Open" (don't double-click)
4. **Confirm**: Click "Open" when macOS asks for confirmation
5. **Permissions**: Grant notification permissions when prompted

**Alternative bypass method:**
```bash
# Remove quarantine flag after installing to Applications
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/HourlyNotes.app
```

## üìñ How to Use

### Menu Bar Options

Click the üìù icon in your menu bar to access:

- **Add Note Now** - Manually record what you're working on
- **EOD (End of Day)** - Stop notifications for the rest of today
- **Today's Summary** - View your activities with calendar navigation
- **Settings** - Configure your work hours
- **Quit** - Exit the application

### Calendar Navigation

The "Today's Summary" feature includes a visual calendar where you can:
- Click any date to view notes from that day
- Navigate between months using arrow buttons
- See your complete activity history
- Search through past accomplishments

### Data Storage

All your notes are stored locally in `~/.notes.txt` with this format:
```
2024-08-30T14:00:00 | Tried new attention mechanism - training diverged after 50 epochs, probably too high lr
2024-08-30T15:00:00 | Team meeting - advisor wants CVPR draft by next Friday, need to prioritize results
2024-08-30T16:00:00 | Fixed GAN discriminator! Issue was batch norm placement, loss stable now
2024-08-30T17:00:00 | Failed experiment: StyleGAN with CLIP loss - mode collapse after 20k steps, skip this approach
```

## ‚ö° Why HourlyNotes?

### The Problem
- **Procrastination**: Always planning to "log it later" but never doing it

- **Missed Learning Opportunities**: Valuable insights from failures get forgotten

### The Solution
- **Bite-Sized Logging**: Break down documentation into tiny, manageable pieces
- **Real-Time Capture**: Log things while they're fresh in your memory
- **No Judgment**: Capture successes AND failures equally
- **Weekly Report Builder**: Automatically have all the breadcrumbs for comprehensive reports
- **Failure Documentation**: Never lose insights from experiments that didn't work
- **Procrastination-Friendly**: Designed for people who hate logging but need to do it
